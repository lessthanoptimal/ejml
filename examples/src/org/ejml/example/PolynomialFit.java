 * This example demonstrates how a polynomial can be fit to a set of data.  This is done by
 * using a least squares solver that is adjustable.  By using an adjustable solver elements
 * can be inexpensively removed and the coefficients recomputed.  This is much less expensive
 * than resolving the whole system from scratch.
