2010/11/20

    significantly degraded after they started to use very light weight wrappers.

  * Yes these changes were statistically significant.
- Changed behavior of CommonOps.extract() to make its behavior match other submatrix operations better

  * Added compact QR to generic tests
- Fixed bug in LinearSolverFactory.symmetric() where LU instead of cholesky was being created.
- EjmlParameters.MEMORY provides a way for it to select algorithms which are fast but memory hogs or
  slower but more memory efficient.
