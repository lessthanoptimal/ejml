 * <p>
 * A matrix decomposition is an algorithm which decomposes the input matrix into a set of equivalent
 * matrices that store the same information as the original. Decompositions are useful
 * in that they allow specialized efficient algorithms to be run on generic input
 * matrices.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * By default most decompositions will modify the input matrix. This is done to save
 * memory and simply code by reducing the number of cases which need to be tested.
